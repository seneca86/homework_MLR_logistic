    "# Homework MLR and logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## MLR\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Import `seaborn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `statsmodels.formula.api`\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Load the dataset \"taxis\" by using `sns.load_dataset(\"taxis\")``\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Use the `assign` command and the `pd.to_datetime` command to transform the columns `dropoff` and `pickup` from strings to timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Create a column called duration which is the difference between dropoff and pickup time, and another one called `duration_min` which is the duration in minutes; hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.assign(\n",
    "    duration=df.dropoff - df.pickup,\n",
    "    duration_min=lambda x: x.duration.dt.total_seconds() / 60,\n",
    "    unit_fare=lambda x: x.fare / (x.distance + 1e-6),\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Create a column called `unit_fare` which is the fare divided by the distance; when dividing, add a small number such as 0.001 to the denominator to avoid numerical problems\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Drop `nan`s from columns `total`, `unit_fare`, `distance`, `tip`, `tolls`, and `duration_min`\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Fit a multiple linear regression with those variables, and print the results\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) Do the same but including the distance squared; hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "formula = \"total ~ np.power(distance, 2) + distance + tip + tolls\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(9) Plot the dataset (you do not need to plot the model); hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "Path(\"plots\").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n",
    "import matplotlib as mpl\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "mpl.rcParams[\"figure.dpi\"] = 150\n",
    "sns.set_theme()\n",
    "scatter_mlr = sns.relplot(\n",
    "    data=df,\n",
    "    x=\"distance\",\n",
    "    y=\"total\",\n",
    "    style=None,\n",
    "    palette=\"deep\",\n",
    "    markers=None,\n",
    "    col=\"color\",\n",
    "    kind=\"scatter\",\n",
    "    hue=\"pickup_borough\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "scatter_mlr.savefig(\"plots/scatter_mlr.png\")\n",
    "plt.clf()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(10) Reflect on the results: which variables are important? What do you think of the p-values and the R squared? Which model works best? Is it intuitive? Write your reflections as comments in the code (place a `#` at the beginning of the line); be concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Similarly to before, load the dataset \"exercise\"\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Assign a boolean variables called \"no fat\" that is one for no fat diets and zero for low fat diets; also, convert `pulse` to `float`; hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df_logit = df_logit.assign(\n",
    "    fat=(df_logit.diet == \"no fat\").astype(int),\n",
    "    pulse=df_logit.pulse.astype(float)\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Plot the dataset using the command from the exercise above; you have some freedom, but you should use \"fat\" as variable `y` and \"pulse\" as variable `x`; there is no \"right\" setting here for `hue`, `kind`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Fit a `logit` model with the following formula and print the summary of the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "formula = \"fat ~ pulse + C(kind) + C(time)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Define a certain subject with a pulse of 120 is resting state after 15 minutes. How likely it is that this subject is on a zero fat diet? Hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "subject = pd.DataFrame([[120, \"rest\", \"15 min\"]], columns=['pulse', 'kind', 'time'])\n",
    "y = results_logit.predict(subject)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Reflect on the results: which variables are important? What do you think of the p-values and the R squared? Which model works best? Is it intuitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your reflections as comments in the code (place a `#` at the beginning of the line); be concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry about the underlying biology; maybe low fat is better for you than zero fat, but this is not a biology class :-)"
